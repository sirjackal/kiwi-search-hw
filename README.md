# Kiwi.com experimental flights search

This app was written as a part of homework for developers interested in [Modern JS weekend](https://jsweekend.cz/)
organized by [Kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com/). It's used for searching flight connections.

## TODO:

- BEM / Bootstrap?
- GitHub
- index.html template - meta tags, favicon etc.
- manifest.json
- methods documentation
- run app publicly
- write proper description in README.md
- distinguish input errors (Location has not been found) vs. backend error (syntax error in query)

- Moment: https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/
